# Returned as section text when a page comes back with its content gone and
# only LinkedIn's own navigation and footer left.
#
# Read carefully: that condition is a *guess* that the page was throttled, not
# an observation of one. It arrived in d8b4c62 with no cited evidence, LinkedIn
# documents no such behaviour, and nobody here has reproduced it deliberately —
# doing so would mean provoking a real throttle on a real account. The log line
# hedges with "likely" for the same reason.
#
# The same empty shell could also be a layout change, a resource this account
# cannot see, or a load that gave up. A session LinkedIn ended is the one
# alternative already ruled out elsewhere: every navigation checks the URL
# against the auth-blocker patterns first, and a redirect to /login, /authwall
# or /checkpoint raises before extraction is reached. That check stays on URLs
# deliberately — body text would be a per-locale guess, and this project's
# rule is that classification never depends on text values.

    One shape for every caller, because the alternative is what this codebase
    did until now: most call sites dropped the sentinel and returned the
    section as simply absent. An agent reading an empty section with no error
    concludes there was nothing to find and calls again, which is the opposite
    of what a rate limit asks for. Being told is what lets a client back off.

    Note this reports the *heuristic's* verdict, with the caveats on
    ``RATE_LIMITED_SECTION_TEXT`` above, and does not make it more accurate.
    What it changes is that a wrong verdict is now visible and can be argued
    with, where a silently missing section could not be.
