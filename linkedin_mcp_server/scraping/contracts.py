# Read carefully: that condition is a *guess* that the page was throttled, not
# an observation of one. It arrived in d8b4c62 with no cited evidence, LinkedIn
# documents no such behaviour, and nobody here has reproduced it deliberately —
# doing so would mean provoking a real throttle on a real account. The log line
# hedges with "likely" for the same reason.
#
# The same empty shell could also be a layout change, a resource this account
# cannot see, or a load that gave up. A session LinkedIn ended is the one
# alternative already ruled out elsewhere: every navigation checks the URL
# against the auth-blocker patterns first, and a redirect to /login, /authwall
# or /checkpoint raises before extraction is reached. That check stays on URLs
# deliberately — body text would be a per-locale guess, and this project's
# rule is that classification never depends on text values.

# `except Exception` and discards any result returned from the cancelled
# scope. The caller gets a timeout that carries no `retry_safe`, and this line
# is then the only record that a message may already have left. Answering the
# caller instead needs the tool to know its own deadline, which is issue #889.

    concludes there was nothing to find and calls again, which is the opposite
