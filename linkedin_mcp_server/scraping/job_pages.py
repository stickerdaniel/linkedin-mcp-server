# The id is the trailing run of digits, and LinkedIn serves the same job under
# both `/jobs/view/1967281839/` and `/jobs/view/<title>-at-<company>-1967281839/`.
# Anchoring the digits to the front of the segment loses the slugged form
# entirely, and reads `2026` out of a title that opens with a year.
#
# The slug is anything but a separator, not `[\w-]`: JS `\w` is ASCII, and a
# localized title reaches this as `d%C3%A9veloppeur-web-at-koul-3510216552`,
# where the `%` ends the match and the id is lost. Measured on the guest
# search API for `developpeur`, where 6 of 10 hrefs were percent-encoded.
# The authenticated pages this server visits serve bare ids today (measured
# across job search, collections and a French search: 0 slugs in 27 anchors),
# so this branch is defensive on both counts.
# `scoped` runs the sidebar's own rule again and reads only the container it
# names, because everything outside it is not a search result: the detail pane
# holds its own permalink and, once opened, a similar-jobs module, and counting
# those as rendered results advances the offset past results the rail never
# showed. Re-run rather than remembered, so a rail replaced between the scroll
# and this call is followed instead of silently widening the scope back to the
# document. `get_saved_jobs` reads the document, having no sidebar to scroll
# and no second list to be confused with.
